# Sorting Hat
This was a project for the NSS Front End Web Dev program. Welcome to Hogwarts! All new students must be sorted into a House. This program allows the user to add students to be randomly assigned to the 4 different Hogwarts houses. If the student is expelled, then they are sent to join Voldemort's army. They can then be deleted from the app by using the Unspeakable curse!!!

## About the user
The ideal user would be someone that wants a fun way to randomly assign a group of people to smaller groups.

## Features
-New Students are added to an array of Hogwarts students and randomly assigned to a house.
-Once assigned, they are added to the DOM and the cards are sorted by House name.
-If the student is expelled, they are added to Voldemort's Army, a different array of baddies, and randomly given a reason for being expelled.
-If they are especially bad, they can be deleted by using the unspeakable curse!!!!
