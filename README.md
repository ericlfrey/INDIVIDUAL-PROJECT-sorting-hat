# Sorting Hat
This was a project for the NSS Front End Web Dev program. Welcome to Hogwarts! All new students must be sorted into a House. This program allows the user to add students to be randomly assigned to the 4 different Hogwarts houses. If the student is expelled, then they are sent to join Voldemort's army. From there, they can seek redemption and be readmitted into Hogwarts. If they fall victim of the Unspeakable Curse, they can be resurrected back into the school, retaining their orignal House. There is also an edit feature where the student's name, House, and student/Death Eater status can be edited.
